# Animation for Uniper by Mediamakers AB

## Goal
The goal is to have a fully responsive interactive animation. The animation is divided in to steps each step has a respective step button. When a button is pressed a textbox will appear and that animation step will play in a loop until another button is presses.

## Suggested features
- Loading screen that shows before animation is loaded.

## Implementation
- Font is now loaded from the fonts directory in assets, change the file path to where your fonts is stored and delete the fonts folder inside assets folder.
- Change file paths for mm_anim_script.js and lottie.js in index.html if the files are moved.
- Change file path for mm_style.css in index.html if the files are moved.
- The lottie.js and mm_animation_english.json needs to stay in the same folder.
- Move div with id "tanim" to new page location.
- Move script tags from index.html to new page location.
- In mm_style.css there is a body property that removes padding and margins which you might wabt to remove depending on the rest of the page.

## Security
- To run the animation lottieplayer is needed which is a JS file that needs to be located in the same folder as the mm_animation.json.json file. There is a security concern about the player making outside calls. I have not found that it does but i have also been in contact with the lottie players engenering team and they confirm that the player is safe to use.

- There are no cdns or api:s used for fonts, styling or logic.
- Everything is coded with HTML, CSS and JS.
- Animation is done with adobe After Effects and exported to a .json file.
